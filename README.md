### Troubleshooting
- If `pip` fails, ensure it's updated: `pip install --upgrade pip`.
- On macOS, if you see permission errors, try `pip install --user` or use `sudo`.
- On Windows, ensure Python is in your PATH (check with `python --version`).
- Verify module installation with `pip show PyQt5 requests`.
